**A small game project in Godot 4 where you make, and try to uncover, fraud**

# Introduction
The point of this game was to increase my familiarity with Godot 4, especially the changes brought in GDscript 2.0 and Networking.

It's a turn based board game about fraud, where a schemer creates a cork board plot to scam, launder money, and commit financial crimes, and the other player investigates newspaper articles and the various parties involved to uncover the whole scam.
